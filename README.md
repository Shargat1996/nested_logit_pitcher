#  Nested Logit Pitcher Model

This project simulates a 3-stage nested logistic model for baseball:
1. Pitcher selects pitch type.
2. Batter decides to swing.
3. Ball location and airball probability determine if it's caught ("strike").

We visualize strike probabilities with an animated heatmap over a realistic baseball field.
